# Livs_Memory_Game
The game initializes with a grid of face-down cards. Each card has a hidden symbol, and the player needs to match pairs of card. A countdown timer starts, and the player needs to match all pairs before the timer reaches zero. When a pair is successfully matched, the cards remain face up, and the player proceeds to the next pair.
